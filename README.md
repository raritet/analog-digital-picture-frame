[This](http://www.ofbrooklyn.com/2014/01/2/building-photo-frame-raspberry-pi-motion-detector/) blog post by Samuel Clay was the source of a lot of my information in the implementation of this project. I just realized that there is a Github repository for the project, so I forked it from [here](https://github.com/samuelclay/Raspberry-Pi-Photo-Frame).
